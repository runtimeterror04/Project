# Project
The program is inside the "code" folder

Before running the code, make sure you have all the libraries installed
Libraries required are
praw, tweepy, ibm-watson, stackapi, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, pillow

Run the following command for every library mentioned in your command line
```
pip install [library name]
```

As of now, the speech-to-text _will only accept mp3 audio file_
Please enter the entire file path, file name, and the file extension while using it.

Transcribing audio will take slightly longer than the duration of the audio. During this time it will show **_(not responding)_**. Please be patient and wait for the transcript to be completed.

If at any stage it shows **_(not responding)_**, please do not click or try to move any window. Doing so will crash python.

Make sure that the image _"stack_howto.jpg"_ is in the same folder as the python file.
